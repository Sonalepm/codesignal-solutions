<!-- Write a function that takes a string s, iterates through it, and collects all 0-based positions of vowels in it to a list.

Note that you should not use any Python built-in string methods to solve this task.

For example, print(solution("Hello WORLD")) should output [1, 4, 7]. Here, 'e' is a vowel, and its position in the string "Hello" is 1. 'o' is also a vowel, and its position is 4. The last vowel is O at position 7.

def solution(s):
    vowels = set('aAeEiIoOuU');
    result = []
    for ind,i in enumerate(s):
        if i in vowels:
            result.append(ind)
    return result
