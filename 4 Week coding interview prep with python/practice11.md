You are given a list of integers. Your task is to write a Python function to find the second-largest number among these integers. If the list has fewer than two unique numbers, return None.

You are not allowed to use any built-in Python functions or methods such as sorted(), max(), or sort(). Instead, you should implement the task using basic list operations.
